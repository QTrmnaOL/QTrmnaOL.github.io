230+ regular maps should really be treated differently from corruption
they don't have block pierce, and no special abilities

            Voidmaps:
            //TODO: Account for magmated voidmaps. (not /2)
            //TODO: Account for daily.
On Voids Diff:
if you have enough HP to survive poisonous without genetecists, i guess its easy

poison is really bad before you get geneticists for example
before you have geneticists poisonous is just awful
if you block everything, heinous is awful
if you almost block everything, destructive is awful
and then the double hit is somewhere in the middle

yeah i think they shift a lot depending on how strong you are
if you're strong enough that doing voids at 190 is a joke but can't do them later after you finish corrupted for example

for me right now I usually block close to 100% of the damage, which is why destruction and heinous are worst

poison is completely trivial when the maps are already easy

destruction = % damage, heinous = crit

if you're trying to do the void maps before you're actually strong though poison is a killer

yea thats a good point, people doing them at the challenge boundary vs at the end of their run

I also thing the difficulty check should consider block, if it doesn't already do that

i always found poison to be the most obnoxious of them early on because when you don't even have geneticists to fire to make breeding faster again it just takes sooo long

for a large part of the game I only did VMs when I could completely block everything, which made them trivial            


TODO LIST: 8/17/2016

Near Future:
------------
Essence graph
Add notes to graph runs.
 it doesnt go into the map bonus mode soon enough because of the fact that its gauging the zone on non-corrupted enemies
  //we will get at least 85 toxstacks from the 1st voidmap UNLESS we have overkill, then we dont get enough.
if a new fight group is available and anticipation stacks aren't 30, abandon and grab a new group

  
New Features To Add:
----------------
Documentation (started)
Update README (always do this)
Code Comments (getting better)


Bugs To Fix:
----------------

Bone Portal messes with graphs / Importing a savedgame in progress produces bad graphs


Other Improvements:
----------------
Void Map Farming
    - based on how much damage you do rather than your health/survival

Programming/CodeWise:
----------------------
Rewrite the automaps way of deciding/picking/buying/running maps.
Also while doing this, determine more refined rules for entering the 3 modes: want dmg/want health/farming
